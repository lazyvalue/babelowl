      <h1>THE BABEL OWL DESCENDS FROM ITS FORSAKEN TOWER</h1>

      <p>
      Babelowl is a Twilio translation application clumsily written in Haskell.
      </p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        "The Babel fish is small, yellow, leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the universe. It feeds on brain wave energy, absorbing all unconscious frequencies and then excreting telepathically a matrix formed from the conscious frequencies and nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain, the practical upshot of which is that if you stick one in your ear, you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language: the speech you hear decodes the brain wave matrix."
        <br/>-- <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i></blockquote>

      <p>The Babelowl works exactly the same way, except you send a text to <b>+1 925-326-6177</b> with a sentence that you would like translated followed by the phrase 'in language' where language is one of Spanish, German, French, or Italian. The Babelowl will send you back a text translation, and call you with a pronunciation in its soothing robotic voice.</b>
     <p>For example: 'i am going to need a considerable greater volume of waffles than you have served me in german'</p>
     <p>This was a tool to help me learn about functional programming and Twilio's awesome API.</p>
